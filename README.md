# GPT-2 Rebuild Project

This project aims to reconstruct GPT-2 from scratch to gain a deep understanding of its architecture and mechanisms. By implementing each component manually, I explore the inner workings of transformer models, attention mechanisms, and language modeling techniques.

## Goals

- Rebuild GPT-2 step by step
- Document and explain each part of the model
- Facilitate learning and experimentation
